# redmapel

Redmapel is intended to be a simple single-purpose library. It is
designed to let you easily manage a tree of related values and set
triggers to fire when elements of the tree have changed. Of course
"changed" is a funny term in Clojure's persistent state world, so read
on.

## History and Naming

Redmapel is small state tree library, named after the stunning [red
maple
tree](http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/view-image.php?image=12819&picture=red-maple-tree),
the state tree of Rhode Island. (groan!)

The misspelling is deliberate, to make it easier to search for
Redmapel. Pronounciation: whatever you like in the privacy of your own
room, but I favor rhyming with the French m'appelle. [see
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H59Py7KApU).

## Background

Redmapel is loosely inspired by the state management ideas of
[Pedestal](http://pedestal.io/). But, I wanted something much simpler,
and without all of Pedestal's learning curve.

## Usage
